# Jiascheduler

**English** Â· [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](./README.zh-CN.md) Â· [Wiki](https://github.com/jiawesoft/jiascheduler/wiki/Install)

An open-source, high-performance, scalable task scheduler written in Rust, supporting dynamic configuration. It can push user scripts to tens of thousands of instances simultaneously and collect execution results in real time.

Jiascheduler does not require script execution nodes to be on the same network. It incorporates an ingenious network penetration model, allowing a single console to manage nodes across different subnets. For example, you can use https://jiascheduler.iwannay.cn to push scripts for execution on Tencent Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, and Amazon Cloud simultaneously, or even deploy scripts on your home computer.

To facilitate node management, Jiascheduler also provides a powerful web SSH terminal, supporting multi-session operations, split-screen, file uploads, downloads, and more.

## Quick start

In addition to using the test server provided in the demo address, you can also deploy your own Agent. Once successfully deployed, the Agent will automatically connect to the jiascheduler online console. Through the console, you can check the Agent's status, execute scripts, view execution results, and initiate SSH connections.

```bash
# Only use job scheduling capability
./jiascheduler-agent --comet-addr ws://115.159.194.153:3000 --assign-username guest --assign-password guest

# Utilize job scheduling and webssh capabilities
./jiascheduler-agent --comet-addr ws://115.159.194.153:3000 --assign-username guest --assign-password guest --ssh-user your_ssh_user --ssh-port 22 --ssh-password your_ssh_user_password --namespace home
```

If you need to log off the node, simply exit the agent

### Single-Instance Deployment

Jiascheduler consists of four executable programs:

1.  jiascheduler-console: The console service, which provides the web console interface.

2.  jiascheduler-comet: The connection layer service, which offers a unified access layer for agents to connect.

3.  jiascheduler-agent: The local agent program, responsible for executing tasks.

4.  jiascheduler: A bundled version of the above three services, designed for simple and quick deployment on a single node.
    Itâ€™s important to note that the bundled jiascheduler service also supports connections from different agents.
    Even if you deploy the bundled version of jiascheduler, you can still deploy additional comet and agent instances.

For single-instance deployment, you only need to execute the following:

```bash
// Access localhost:9090 via a browser to complete the initial setup.
// After the initial setup, the configuration file will be loaded, and there is no need to pass `--bind-addr` for subsequent restarts.
// The default path for the generated configuration file is $HOME/.jiascheduler/console.toml.
./jiascheduler --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:9090
```

### Docker Deployment

Create a `.env` file in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```shell
WORKCONF=/data/jiascheduler
WORKDATA=/data/jiascheduler
```

The `console.toml` file has a default path of /root/.jiascheduler/console.toml in the container. If this configuration file does not exist, accessing the console page will redirect you to the initialization setup page.

If the `console.toml` file exists, accessing the console page will directly take you to the login page. Below is a reference configuration. Save the following content as `console.toml` and place it in the `$WORKCONF/.jiascheduler` directory.

```yml
debug = false
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:9090"
api_url = ""
redis_url = "redis://default:3DGiuazc7wkAppV3@redis"
comet_secret = "rYzBYE+cXbtdMg=="
database_url = "mysql://root:kytHmeBR4Vg@mysql:3306/jiascheduler"

[encrypt]
private_key = "QGr0LLnFFt7mBFrfol2gy"

[admin]
username = "admin"
password = "qTQhiMiLCb"
```

After executing docker compose up -d, access 0.0.0.0:9090 to enter the console interface.
